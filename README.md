# code-template
This is a template repository for code projects. You can use it as a template to start a new research project. Click on the `Use this template` button ☝️. You must be logged in to your GitHub account to use the template.

# Rules
- Folder names should always be in small letters and begin with a number.
- No spaces are allowed in folder or file names. You have to use the underscore "_."
- The folders should be numbered in chronological order, i.e., those in the initial part of your work should have a smaller number.
- Every folder should have a readme file that should contain a description of the contents of that folder.

# Folder structure

The folders follow a 5-level wide and 3-level deep structure. That means it is preferable to have only five folders at a certain level, and the structuring of the information should be done in such a way that it is only 3-levels deep, starting from the top-level folder. This is necessary for the retrieval of the information at a later day.

| Name                 | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|1_workshop|This folder is a dedicated space within your project structure for all materials related to workshops, experimentation, and temporary code exploration. To maintain the cleanliness and focus of the `2_main_code` folder, it is recommended to house any experimental or temporary code within the "1_workshop" folder. This separation is instrumental in preserving the structure and integrity of the primary codebase in  `2_main_code`.|
|2_main_code|The heart of your project resides in this folder. It houses the primary codebase, including source code files, scripts, libraries, and all essential components crucial for your project's main functionality. |
|7_daily_logs|This folder is designed to meticulously document daily progress, activities, and issues about your project. Daily logs are fundamental for tracking day-to-day developments and challenges, proving invaluable for effective project management and post-project analysis.|
|8_meetings|This folder is the central hub for materials associated with project meetings. It encompasses meeting agendas, minutes, presentations, and other relevant documents or files linked to project discussions and decisions. This organization ensures that meeting-related information is well-structured and swiftly accessible when needed.|
|9_template |Do not touch this folder. It contains the templates that are used in other parts of the project.|


**Note: See the readme file inside the folder for more details.**
